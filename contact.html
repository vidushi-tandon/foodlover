<p>Hello! My name is Vidushi Tandon and I am a Year 11 student at Sacred Heart College, Lower Hutt in New Zealand. Before I made this website, I wasn’t really into baking and cooking, but I was really into eating. Then I made my first dish: cheese pasta, which I was extremely proud of and without any help!</p>

<p>Slowly, I got the feeling of baking and I started off from Betty Crocker’s mixes which is a great way of learning how to bake for beginners! I made chocolate cake, muffins, pizza and sugar cookies with my family then I made chocolate cookies by myself which I was happy about because it was only my 2nd attempt and I did so well in my family’s opinion. </p>

<p>These reviews are only a few of my favourite foods but I also love Burgerfuel’s V8 Vegan Burger, Indo Mie noodles, Wild Berry Kahurangi ice cream, feijoas, bananas, brownies, and I could go on forever! I generally enjoy all foods, mostly that are recommended highly by a lot of people. Have a lovely day :)</p>
<p>Oh and by the way, if you're wondering where I got this lovely picture from, I took it myself, on a beautiful evening by my sister's bedroom window with my OPPO  A75 Phone 20MP A.I Camera. I wanted to set it at the sky, to get that original pink feeling! :)</p>
